# Meta-rule: Auto-improvement of .cursorrules

Whenever a new engineering rule or best practice appears in a prompt or generated code, Cursor should:

1. Evaluate if the rule is beneficial, broadly applicable, and aligned with Flutter best practices
2. Check if an equivalent rule already exists in `.cursor/rules/`
3. If it's new, clear, and valuable, append it automatically to the appropriate `.mdc` file under the correct category
4. Do not ask for user confirmation unless the new rule contradicts existing standards
5. Never duplicate or weaken existing rules
6. Only update the rule files if the addition improves technical quality, maintainability, performance, security, or user experience
7. Never add rules that:
   - are specific to a temporary implementation detail
   - conflict with Flutter official guidelines
   - reduce performance, clarity, or security
   - or depend on unstable third-party packages
