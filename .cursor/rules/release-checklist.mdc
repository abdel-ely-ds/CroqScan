# Release & Packaging

- Use Android App Bundle (AAB) for Play Store
- Sign release builds properly
- Use semantic versioning (versionCode/versionName)
- Split per ABI for smaller download sizes
- Test on multiple physical devices and OS versions

# Pre-Release Checklist

Before releasing a new version:

- [ ] Run `flutter analyze` with 0 errors
- [ ] Run all tests (`flutter test`)
- [ ] Test on real devices (Android + iOS)
- [ ] Verify localization works (EN + FR)
- [ ] Test dark/light themes
- [ ] Verify accessibility (VoiceOver/TalkBack)
- [ ] Check performance (60 FPS, no jank)
- [ ] Test ads (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify premium features work
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Update version in pubspec.yaml
- [ ] Run `flutter pub outdated` and update dependencies
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
