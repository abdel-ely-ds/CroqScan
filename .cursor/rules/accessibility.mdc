# Accessibility (a11y) Requirements

- Use Semantics widgets for interactive elements
- Maintain minimum touch target size (48x48 dp)
- Support dynamic text scaling
- Ensure contrast ratio meets WCAG AA
- Add accessible labels for images, buttons, and inputs
- Control focus order with FocusScope and traversal policies
- Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS)

# Enhanced Accessibility Testing

1. Automate accessibility tests to validate:

   - Semantics tree structure
   - Labels for all interactive elements
   - Focus order
   - Dynamic text scaling

2. Test TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS) behavior programmatically

3. Validate contrast ratios dynamically for light and dark themes

4. Ensure widgets respect:

   - Reduced motion preferences
   - Accessibility settings

5. Include accessibility checks in CI to prevent regressions

6. Flag violations:

   - Missing accessibility labels
   - Incorrect focus order
   - WCAG AA standards violations
   - Touch targets < 48x48 dp
