## 💡 Tips to Get Started

### In the Flutter Terminal (while app is running)

Type:

- `r` → Hot reload (fast, keeps state)
- `R` → Hot restart (restarts app)
- `p` → Show debug painting
- `q` → Quit

### VS Code / Android Studio

- **Ctrl/Cmd + S** → Save (triggers hot reload)
- **Ctrl/Cmd + /** → Comment/uncomment
- **Alt + Shift + F** → Format code

### Organization

1. **Create a Git branch** before modifying:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-first-feature
   ```

2. **Commit often**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [your feature]"
   ```

3. **Test regularly** on emulator AND real device
