## 🚦 Traffic Light Status

### ✅ Green (Ready)
- Project structure
- Code quality
- Architecture
- Language policy
- Core functionality

### 🟡 Yellow (Good, Can Improve)
- Test coverage (35% → target 70%)
- Widget tests (some minor failures)
- Accessibility (basic, can enhance)

### 🔴 Red (Not Blocking, Optional)
- Dependency injection (static services work fine)
- Service test mocks (tests written, need mocking setup)
- Advanced state management (current approach works)

## 💡 Tips

### For New Developers
1. Read `FINAL_SUMMARY.md` first
2. Then `README.md` for setup
3. Then `ARCHITECTURE.md` for context
4. Check `.cursor/rules/` for coding standards

### For Code Reviews
1. Run `flutter analyze` (should be 0 errors)
2. Run `flutter test` (25+ should pass)
3. Check `.cursor/rules/` for standards

### For Cursor AI
- Use `@rule-name` to invoke specific rules
- Rules auto-attach based on file patterns
- Core rules always apply
